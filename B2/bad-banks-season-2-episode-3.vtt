00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:36.641
Drink this.

2
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:46.921
Thank you.

3
00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:53.001
I brought you here right away.

4
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:55.321
No one saw you like this.

5
00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:58.361
You must take care of yourself.

6
00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:01.961
I visit a Turkish bath twice a week.

7
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:04.161
Have them massage me.

8
00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:06.401
Scrub my old skin off.

9
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:10.441
Relaxing is part of being professional.

10
00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:13.921
You don't have to tell anyone.

11
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:19.921
Congratulations on Leipzig.

12
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:31.761
The Global
had a project called Quaestus.

13
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:36.161
It was a huge flop
but was sold nonetheless.

14
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.321
And no one knows why.

15
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:41.041
Okay.

16
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:44.321
I'll look into it.

17
00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:50.401
Keep it up.

18
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:10.121
Do you like it?

19
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:45.761
Do you notice anything?

20
00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:05.281
We had an agreement.

21
00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:07.041
Exactly.

22
00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:10.001
It's alright.

23
00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:12.481
Hi, boss.

24
00:03:12.961 --> 00:03:14.641
- It's broken.
- Oh.

25
00:03:16.521 --> 00:03:20.001
Let's have a look.

26
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:30.881
Your deal with Schultheiss
was a one-time thing.

27
00:03:31.321 --> 00:03:35.841
Understood? And if you do anything
against my wishes again,

28
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:37.081
I won't wait for the results.

29
00:03:37.641 --> 00:03:39.561
I'll fire you that very day.

30
00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:42.681
- Understood.
- If we don't...

31
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:43.601
- Hello.
- Hey.

32
00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:46.081
If we don't close in four weeks,

33
00:03:46.281 --> 00:03:47.441
Leipzig will sue us.

34
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.001
Okay?

35
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:51.201
So.

36
00:03:53.241 --> 00:03:54.921
You got us into this,

37
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:57.881
so you'll fix it.

38
00:03:58.881 --> 00:04:01.121
You're in charge of the project.

39
00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:05.281
Yes.

40
00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:07.601
Dave, get up.
The f***ing phone please.

41
00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:10.001
Thanks. Call your mummy later.

42
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:15.041
The closing for Leipzig2025
is in less than four weeks.

43
00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:16.361
Four! Yes.

44
00:04:17.161 --> 00:04:20.801
That means that all securitized loans
must be sold by then.

45
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:22.921
Admittedly, that's not much time.

46
00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:27.001
I hope you all brought
your toothbrushes.

47
00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.201
- You look good.
- Cancel all appointments.

48
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:31.241
Eat plenty of white bread.

49
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:34.441
Yes, white bread, so you don't have
to constantly crap.

50
00:04:35.521 --> 00:04:36.521
Here's the crazy woman

51
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:38.721
responsible for all of this.

52
00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:42.241
She's in charge of the project.
Jana Liekam.

53
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:50.481
I don't know why you Dutchmen
talk so much.

54
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:54.001
You heard it.
Four weeks is not much.

55
00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:56.241
But I'm very optimistic
that we can do it.

56
00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:57.601
- Okay.
- Close it.

57
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:02.001
Adam, you know people
at the pension funds.

58
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:03.481
- Can you take on Double B?
- No.

59
00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:06.481
Adam is an expert on gorillas
and perverts.

60
00:05:06.921 --> 00:05:08.521
And alpha males.

61
00:05:08.721 --> 00:05:10.081
So you'll take over
the entire risk tranche?

62
00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:11.001
Oh yes.

63
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:13.161
Will you handle the final
of the roadshow?

64
00:05:13.641 --> 00:05:16.041
- Okay.
- Good. Then let's go.

65
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:22.041
This is the project team Leipzig2025.

66
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:35.721
Adam.

67
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:37.721
Get to work!

68
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.441
We have much to do.

69
00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:46.081
Michi, how's your divorce going?

70
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:49.881
Have you heard of Leipzig2025?

71
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:52.561
Laurie, how are you?

72
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:57.841
Here are the A tranches
at 80 base points. 25 swaps.

73
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:00.921
20 it is. Great.

74
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:02.481
I'll send you the files.

75
00:06:02.681 --> 00:06:05.161
- Thanks. My regards to Robert.
- Bye.

76
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.761
If things continue like this,

77
00:06:09.961 --> 00:06:12.681
I won't need you or you or you anymore.

78
00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:14.961
I don't need you.

79
00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:18.201
I make the best trades myself.

80
00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:19.881
How is Adam?

81
00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:23.441
- Something is wrong with him.
- Why?

82
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:25.081
He has so many allergies.

83
00:06:26.401 --> 00:06:28.241
Who is allergic to chilli?

84
00:06:28.441 --> 00:06:30.561
He wouldn't be able to drink this.

85
00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:31.881
Chilli...

86
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:34.121
And I think his wife beats him.

87
00:06:34.321 --> 00:06:36.841
- Pardon?
- He's always covered in scars.

88
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:38.481
That's right. Like yesterday.

89
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:41.961
His wife. Hm. And your family?

90
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:45.121
Oh, excuse me. The food is hot.
No problem.

91
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:47.601
I'll make you another dish.
Here you go.

92
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:50.601
Thin chicken strips?

93
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:53.481
- Correct. Five euro please.
- Okay.

94
00:06:54.361 --> 00:06:56.681
So you don't want to talk about it.

95
00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:58.001
Cheers.

96
00:07:02.041 --> 00:07:02.961
Cheers.

97
00:07:05.561 --> 00:07:08.641
Mattias! Hey!

98
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:10.561
This is the last round for today.

99
00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:32.561
You're cleaning that up.

100
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:19.761
Black Stone

101
00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:37.961
Silver Mountain is a shell company

102
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:40.601
<i>in a worthless palace here.</i>

103
00:09:41.801 --> 00:09:42.921
Bloody bastards.

104
00:09:44.361 --> 00:09:45.521
But Quaestus surely isn't the only thing

105
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:47.281
they dumped with Silver Mountain.

106
00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:48.201
Mum.

107
00:09:48.401 --> 00:09:49.761
I might be able to determine...

108
00:09:49.961 --> 00:09:50.961
I need money.

109
00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:52.441
- What is it?
- They're gone.

110
00:09:52.961 --> 00:09:54.521
Antoine!

111
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:56.401
I always tell you to speak slowly.

112
00:09:58.801 --> 00:10:00.321
- Hey.
- Hey.

113
00:10:00.521 --> 00:10:02.561
I'm sorry I couldn't answer earlier.
We're so busy.

114
00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:03.481
No problem.

115
00:10:03.681 --> 00:10:05.041
Shall we Skype tomorrow?

116
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:08.041
<i>- Sure.
- Okay.</i>

117
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:09.841
How was Flo's trip?

118
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:13.081
It was nice.

119
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:18.081
A slide.

120
00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:22.121
Okay.

121
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:26.601
I think things will be calmer tomorrow,

122
00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:28.441
so we'll talk then. Okay?

123
00:10:29.081 --> 00:10:30.801
- Okay.
- Good.

124
00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:33.561
- Kiss Flo for me.
- I will.

125
00:10:34.001 --> 00:10:34.921
Until tomorrow.

126
00:10:35.121 --> 00:10:36.121
I miss you both.

127
00:10:36.561 --> 00:10:37.201
Bye.

128
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:58.041
How is she doing in Frankfurt?

129
00:10:58.961 --> 00:11:02.041
- Frankfart.
- Frankfart.

130
00:11:09.161 --> 00:11:11.721
Shall we eat with Mummy? Yes?

131
00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:13.001
I'd like that too.

132
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:15.881
What shall we cook?

133
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:29.521
Quaestus led us to the hedge fund
Silver Mountain,

134
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:30.601
headquartered in Bahrain.

135
00:11:31.481 --> 00:11:33.441
The Global constantly sold them
useless junk.

136
00:11:35.801 --> 00:11:39.801
You think Silver Mountain is
a secret subsidiary of the Global.

137
00:11:40.001 --> 00:11:43.521
They're selling their junk to themselves
to improve their balances.

138
00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:45.761
But I need proof of that.

139
00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:50.681
Do you get along? Fenger and you.

140
00:11:51.921 --> 00:11:52.801
Yes.

141
00:11:53.001 --> 00:11:54.361
If you can get access to his computer,

142
00:11:55.321 --> 00:11:56.801
you'll certainly find something.

143
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:58.401
His computer?

144
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:01.521
Last time, you had scruples too.
But then it was easy.

145
00:12:03.201 --> 00:12:04.681
I'm sure you'll find evidence

146
00:12:04.881 --> 00:12:06.761
in his computer's master data.

147
00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:11.441
I need more evidence,
accounts, sold products.

148
00:12:11.641 --> 00:12:14.081
Who do you think I am?

149
00:12:18.441 --> 00:12:21.121
Sneaking into his office,

150
00:12:21.321 --> 00:12:22.681
hacking into his computer.

151
00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:27.041
I don't even know how to do that.

152
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:29.521
I don't have any other options.

153
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:34.201
What do you even need it for?

154
00:12:40.121 --> 00:12:41.601
I'm not doing it.

155
00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:43.561
Get used to the idea.

156
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:03.361
Am I locked in now?

157
00:13:06.841 --> 00:13:08.761
Oh, come on. What is this?

158
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:17.201
We're cancelling this.

159
00:13:18.481 --> 00:13:20.161
I can see that you're in pain.

160
00:13:20.361 --> 00:13:22.681
We're here already. Give me the keys.

161
00:13:23.601 --> 00:13:25.361
So we'll tour the city.

162
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:29.121
We've never been to Frankfurt together.

163
00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:30.721
Frankfurt.

164
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:33.081
Frankfurt.

165
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.121
I know that this is totally naive.

166
00:13:40.081 --> 00:13:41.761
But there are more important things now.

167
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:43.921
Give me the keys.

168
00:13:53.681 --> 00:13:55.001
Close your eyes.

169
00:13:58.881 --> 00:14:00.921
Do you remember how happy you were?

170
00:14:01.761 --> 00:14:02.841
- Yes.
- Relaxed?

171
00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:04.281
Close your eyes.

172
00:14:04.921 --> 00:14:06.481
Think about Thailand.

173
00:14:10.521 --> 00:14:11.801
Hm.

174
00:14:12.001 --> 00:14:14.961
Instead we're in this ugly hotel room

175
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:16.801
because of this stupid project.

176
00:14:17.241 --> 00:14:19.041
Instead of the two of us...

177
00:14:19.241 --> 00:14:21.681
Instead of the two of us
flying around the world?

178
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:26.121
What do I do while we travel the world?

179
00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.081
You'll never experience this.

180
00:14:38.361 --> 00:14:39.561
Do you realise this?

181
00:14:40.401 --> 00:14:43.201
I'll ensure that the financing
is secured

182
00:14:43.401 --> 00:14:45.121
instead of flying to Thailand

183
00:14:45.561 --> 00:14:47.241
and waiting for my death.

184
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:51.721
I don't care

185
00:14:51.921 --> 00:14:54.801
what other people do
in their last weeks.

186
00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:57.921
Whether they're lying on the beach
or partying.

187
00:14:58.801 --> 00:15:02.001
1 1 years.
I've fought for this for 1 1 years.

188
00:15:02.761 --> 00:15:04.001
That appointment out there,

189
00:15:04.201 --> 00:15:06.801
that's my job, and my job is my life.

190
00:15:22.441 --> 00:15:26.121
Can I count on you?

191
00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:29.321
Where is he?

192
00:15:30.361 --> 00:15:33.241
No one is here,
and his mobile phone is off.

193
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:38.921
Finally.

194
00:15:39.121 --> 00:15:39.841
You're so stupid.

195
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:42.721
You didn't order until three hours ago,
and now you're complaining!

196
00:15:43.121 --> 00:15:44.281
I'm sorry. I'm hysterical.

197
00:15:45.921 --> 00:15:47.761
Why don't you cook yourself?

198
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:49.561
No. Please. It's my mistake.

199
00:15:49.801 --> 00:15:51.401
Have you gone completely mad,
you stupid dog?

200
00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:52.241
Clean that up.

201
00:15:53.201 --> 00:15:54.561
Don't embarrass me further.

202
00:16:14.521 --> 00:16:17.841
Smartcityrising, Leipzig2025.

203
00:16:18.241 --> 00:16:19.681
Wow!

204
00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:22.641
Sadly, I'm too young to say that
I'm too old for this.

205
00:16:24.601 --> 00:16:27.321
Thank you. Yes, I'm too old. Too slow.

206
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:32.681
But ladies and gentlemen,
I don't believe in fairy tales.

207
00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:37.561
But Leipzig2025 is an insane project.

208
00:16:37.921 --> 00:16:40.961
These past days,
my young colleague Jana Liekam

209
00:16:41.161 --> 00:16:43.801
has sold credits totalling a billion.

210
00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:47.201
Yes. Come here. Say something.

211
00:16:49.361 --> 00:16:50.521
Good luck.

212
00:16:53.921 --> 00:16:54.521
Thank you.

213
00:16:55.321 --> 00:16:57.921
Leipzig2025 is more than
just lucrative financing

214
00:16:58.121 --> 00:16:59.441
for you to invest in.

215
00:17:00.041 --> 00:17:02.161
It's also a project with heart and soul.

216
00:17:02.361 --> 00:17:04.241
And representing Leipzig is its mayor,

217
00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:07.681
Peter Schultheiss, whom I'd like
to ask to come up on stage.

218
00:17:16.081 --> 00:17:19.401
Thank you, thank you.

219
00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:22.121
In recent years, large-scale projects
weren't really popular

220
00:17:22.321 --> 00:17:23.841
in politics.

221
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:27.441
I had to pass a test or two myself.

222
00:17:28.561 --> 00:17:31.921
That's why it's so much more touching
to see the many young people

223
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:34.081
who, like me, believe

224
00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:36.321
in offering others a vision,

225
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:38.761
creating housing, affordable housing,

226
00:17:39.561 --> 00:17:41.401
giving them jobs. In short,

227
00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:44.121
being part of developing
a booming metropolis' future.

228
00:17:44.841 --> 00:17:48.841
The future of my hometown. Thank you.

229
00:17:52.361 --> 00:17:53.161
Hey!

230
00:17:55.521 --> 00:17:58.641
That's the way it is. Dads are dads
and family is family.

231
00:17:58.841 --> 00:18:00.041
They're always right.

232
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:01.921
At least we got
to meet your family that way.

233
00:18:02.121 --> 00:18:03.121
I liked it too.

234
00:18:03.321 --> 00:18:04.801
F*** off!

235
00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.401
- Hey!
- Cheers!

236
00:18:06.761 --> 00:18:10.961
May I introduce you to my wife?

237
00:18:11.441 --> 00:18:12.601
Lucia!

238
00:18:16.001 --> 00:18:17.961
Let go off me!

239
00:18:18.561 --> 00:18:19.921
Let go off me!

240
00:18:20.121 --> 00:18:22.241
What's wrong?

241
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:24.841
Please.

242
00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:26.641
Please.

243
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:34.601
So that's Gabriel Fenger's wife.

244
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:37.841
What about Gabriel Fenger's
other big secret?

245
00:18:38.321 --> 00:18:41.001
Do you know what's being said about you?

246
00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:45.401
Who are you again?

247
00:18:45.601 --> 00:18:46.961
I'm Mohammed from accounting.

248
00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:50.881
Ah, okay. What rumour is that?

249
00:18:51.081 --> 00:18:53.761
I'm just saying it's all drivel.

250
00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:56.841
Gabriel.

251
00:18:57.321 --> 00:19:00.361
- Hey. Hi, Gabriel.
- Hello, hello, hello.

252
00:19:00.561 --> 00:19:01.441
How are you?

253
00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:04.561
- Tell me. Which rumour?
- I don't know.

254
00:19:04.761 --> 00:19:07.001
Tell me!

255
00:19:07.201 --> 00:19:09.201
Gabriel.

256
00:19:09.401 --> 00:19:11.361
You might live in this bank.

257
00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:14.001
Who said it? Did you?

258
00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:15.241
No.

259
00:19:15.441 --> 00:19:16.961
I don't even know you.

260
00:19:17.161 --> 00:19:18.761
I don't know who you are!

261
00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:20.241
I don't know. Hey!

262
00:19:20.441 --> 00:19:22.681
Hey, Gabriel! Stop!

263
00:19:23.281 --> 00:19:24.281
Are you mad?

264
00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:25.201
Hey!

265
00:19:25.401 --> 00:19:26.601
Who the f*** are you, man?

266
00:19:26.801 --> 00:19:29.681
You a***hole! I don't even know him!

267
00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:31.241
It's cool.
I went to university with him.

268
00:19:36.361 --> 00:19:38.481
She looks just like the prostitute

269
00:19:38.681 --> 00:19:40.921
whose face I came on yesterday.
I can't believe it.

270
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:43.081
You've improved in recent years.

271
00:19:43.961 --> 00:19:45.801
You're fighting on the wrong side.

272
00:19:46.961 --> 00:19:49.561
You work yourself to death,
but do you have your million?

273
00:19:50.601 --> 00:19:52.841
We really hit the ground running then.

274
00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:55.121
What happened to you?

275
00:19:55.321 --> 00:19:56.361
Dessert?

276
00:19:59.121 --> 00:20:00.081
The bill, please.

277
00:20:06.321 --> 00:20:08.041
Adam, you'll get the offer
for this Leipzig thing tomorrow.

278
00:20:08.361 --> 00:20:11.401
I must have all of the risk shares.
Got it?

279
00:20:11.601 --> 00:20:12.241
Cool.

280
00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:16.601
We have to party again soon.
You know how to do so.

281
00:20:16.801 --> 00:20:17.881
We'll see.

282
00:20:18.081 --> 00:20:20.201
Come on. F*** the family!

283
00:20:25.801 --> 00:20:26.921
I still have the photos of you.

284
00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:36.961
Oh God.

285
00:20:37.481 --> 00:20:40.161
By the way, your wife will get them,
if you turn down our offer.

286
00:20:44.001 --> 00:20:44.801
That's not funny.

287
00:20:45.201 --> 00:20:46.601
Not at all.

288
00:20:48.681 --> 00:20:51.361
Shall I give you a ride
or will you take the tram?

289
00:21:05.641 --> 00:21:06.681
I'll pay now.

290
00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.241
Tom! Tom!

291
00:21:11.441 --> 00:21:12.961
We have to talk about the photos again.

292
00:21:13.161 --> 00:21:15.201
Keep cool. We're going to make
you a fair offer.

293
00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:16.401
Tell me that you were joking.

294
00:21:17.081 --> 00:21:19.121
Want to come to the 'Atelier'
for old times' sake?

295
00:21:19.801 --> 00:21:21.121
Old-school bukkake.

296
00:21:21.601 --> 00:21:22.641
Wow. Keep cool.

297
00:21:22.841 --> 00:21:23.961
This is my family.

298
00:21:25.321 --> 00:21:26.201
I have your photos too.

299
00:21:26.401 --> 00:21:27.881
But I don't have a family.

300
00:21:33.681 --> 00:21:36.241
This deal is important to me.
Accept the offer.

301
00:21:36.761 --> 00:21:38.801
Sorry, buddy. There's no other way.

302
00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:44.441
I'm alive.

303
00:21:51.001 --> 00:21:52.241
It's okay.

304
00:21:58.641 --> 00:21:59.401
Hm?

305
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:10.281
Jana, do you want to know
my real secret?

306
00:22:12.001 --> 00:22:13.481
I don't understand my job.

307
00:22:14.841 --> 00:22:19.841
In the '90s with all that trading,

308
00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:21.601
I made so much money.

309
00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:23.361
I was happy.

310
00:22:23.561 --> 00:22:25.241
Then there was investment banking.

311
00:22:27.161 --> 00:22:30.761
Made even more money.
So much f***ing money!

312
00:22:30.961 --> 00:22:32.961
But every time

313
00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:36.361
I really tried to understand
where the money came from,

314
00:22:36.561 --> 00:22:37.321
why?

315
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:41.321
Why do these bills
come out of the machine?

316
00:22:43.001 --> 00:22:46.881
Somewhere in my line of thought,
there's always the point

317
00:22:47.601 --> 00:22:49.481
where I just didn't understand it.

318
00:22:56.241 --> 00:22:59.761
I once knew a phenomenal banker
who said,

319
00:23:01.921 --> 00:23:04.641
'We align our entire life based on'

320
00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:06.081
'what we want to understand'

321
00:23:07.641 --> 00:23:09.641
'and those things we don't want
to understand'.

322
00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:15.841
I understand you.

323
00:24:42.241 --> 00:24:43.801
Hey, Mohammed! What are you doing?

324
00:24:44.281 --> 00:24:46.961
I'll just address this quickly.
I'll apologise.

325
00:24:47.161 --> 00:24:47.761
Shush.

326
00:24:48.481 --> 00:24:50.921
You're both totally drunk. Okay?

327
00:24:51.761 --> 00:24:56.081
Fenger asked me to analyse
wire transfer from the master data.

328
00:24:56.281 --> 00:24:58.361
But I didn't download anything.

329
00:24:58.561 --> 00:25:01.081
- You have to go to the data centre.
- Okay.

330
00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:02.201
Okay.

331
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:06.401
Could you tell me more about Quaestus?

332
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:08.201
- Quaestus?
- Yes.

333
00:25:08.761 --> 00:25:11.081
I've seen so much sh*t in this bank.

334
00:25:11.281 --> 00:25:12.761
If they want to fire me, I have...

335
00:25:12.961 --> 00:25:13.601
Is something wrong?

336
00:25:22.361 --> 00:25:23.201
No.

337
00:25:25.401 --> 00:25:27.001
Let me take you home.

338
00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:28.961
You can't drive like this.

339
00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:52.001
Mo?

340
00:27:04.641 --> 00:27:05.601
We're here.

341
00:27:10.161 --> 00:27:11.241
Good night.

342
00:27:12.481 --> 00:27:13.841
Thank you, Jana.

343
00:27:44.961 --> 00:27:46.041
No reason to get nervous.

344
00:27:46.241 --> 00:27:47.841
Do I look nervous?

345
00:27:50.601 --> 00:27:53.281
We discussed
appropriate compensation back then.

346
00:27:53.481 --> 00:27:56.961
Given what Silver Mountain
entailed last week,

347
00:27:57.161 --> 00:27:59.681
my compensation isn't appropriate
but a joke.

348
00:27:59.881 --> 00:28:01.601
This was a one-time...

349
00:28:01.801 --> 00:28:05.041
It would have been one-time
had you used Silver Mountain once

350
00:28:05.241 --> 00:28:06.561
to get rid of junk.

351
00:28:06.761 --> 00:28:08.761
But last week's amounts were...

352
00:28:08.961 --> 00:28:10.881
Yes, I got it.

353
00:28:14.081 --> 00:28:14.841
I'll take care of it.

354
00:28:42.081 --> 00:28:43.281
Quaestus?

355
00:29:13.601 --> 00:29:17.041
It's all going downhill.
1.10 now for coffee.

356
00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:20.521
I'll catch up.

357
00:29:24.841 --> 00:29:25.721
Hi, gorgeous man.

358
00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:27.761
Hey, beautiful woman.

359
00:29:31.801 --> 00:29:34.361
- What are you doing here?
- Visiting you.

360
00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:36.921
I'm sorry I didn't respond.

361
00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:38.561
I thought your phone was broken.

362
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:42.201
No, no... I'm just really busy.

363
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:47.401
I'm not wearing anything underneath.

364
00:29:51.361 --> 00:29:53.041
Do you have a boiler room?

365
00:29:55.561 --> 00:29:57.161
I have a date now.

366
00:29:57.761 --> 00:29:59.561
- We have to study for tomorrow.
- Did you not hear me?

367
00:29:59.761 --> 00:30:03.241
I did, but I'm just so busy.

368
00:30:03.441 --> 00:30:04.321
Can I help you?

369
00:30:04.761 --> 00:30:06.081
Maybe another time.

370
00:30:11.161 --> 00:30:11.961
Bye.

371
00:30:13.961 --> 00:30:15.001
Will you call?

372
00:30:15.201 --> 00:30:16.801
Just keep walking.

373
00:30:25.601 --> 00:30:27.881
- Sorry.
- You again!

374
00:30:28.721 --> 00:30:29.721
Do you not have a home?

375
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:33.001
I wanted to ask
if you'd like to have dinner with me.

376
00:30:33.201 --> 00:30:34.481
- Grazyna.
- No.

377
00:30:35.121 --> 00:30:36.321
- Please.
- No.

378
00:30:36.721 --> 00:30:37.961
Pretty please.

379
00:30:38.721 --> 00:30:40.041
What self-confidence.

380
00:30:41.161 --> 00:30:43.001
Last time, you cried here like a child

381
00:30:43.201 --> 00:30:44.841
and told me what a bad man you are.

382
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:46.321
That wasn't even my best side.

383
00:30:46.761 --> 00:30:47.561
Oh?

384
00:30:48.001 --> 00:30:49.841
Your shift ends at 7 o'clock,
doesn't it?

385
00:30:50.041 --> 00:30:52.161
I'll pick you up half past the hour.

386
00:30:52.361 --> 00:30:53.961
I'll find a nice restaurant for us,

387
00:30:54.161 --> 00:30:56.281
and you'll choose something good
from the menu.

388
00:30:58.081 --> 00:30:59.641
I look forward to tonight.

389
00:30:59.841 --> 00:31:00.681
See you soon!

390
00:31:04.761 --> 00:31:05.961
What is it?

391
00:31:12.121 --> 00:31:13.201
I found a client.

392
00:31:14.201 --> 00:31:14.921
One.

393
00:31:15.721 --> 00:31:16.401
One client.

394
00:31:18.241 --> 00:31:20.761
That bloody pleb Tom Moldovan.

395
00:31:21.321 --> 00:31:24.241
Wow. With an offer
I wouldn't even wipe my arse.

396
00:31:24.441 --> 00:31:25.441
I'll keep searching.

397
00:31:25.641 --> 00:31:26.921
But if I fail,
we'll at least have Moldovan.

398
00:31:27.321 --> 00:31:29.681
Have you gone mad?

399
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:34.761
The risk tranche makes up 10 per cent
of our entire credit volume.

400
00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:37.321
Tom Moldovan can choke on his offer.

401
00:31:37.681 --> 00:31:38.881
- Yes...
- No, no!

402
00:31:39.081 --> 00:31:41.361
You're going to find something better.

403
00:31:41.561 --> 00:31:43.561
- Mhm.
- Good.

404
00:31:45.441 --> 00:31:46.761
I've told you from the start

405
00:31:46.961 --> 00:31:48.281
that we didn't have enough time.

406
00:31:49.081 --> 00:31:50.841
I'm telling you

407
00:31:51.041 --> 00:31:52.441
to do your f***ing job!

408
00:31:52.881 --> 00:31:54.241
Acquire a customer

409
00:31:54.601 --> 00:31:57.441
who won't insult me
with such a measly offer.

410
00:32:00.721 --> 00:32:01.561
Yes, Sir.

411
00:32:02.281 --> 00:32:04.841
Ay, Sir. Love you so.

412
00:32:07.561 --> 00:32:10.241
The closing is in two weeks,
and only half of Triple A is gone.

413
00:32:15.601 --> 00:32:18.161
Then why are all of you
still sitting here?

414
00:32:22.961 --> 00:32:24.401
Think of something!

415
00:32:29.841 --> 00:32:32.081
Hello, it's Adam Pohl again.

416
00:32:34.401 --> 00:32:36.481
Okay. I'll try again tomorrow.

417
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:12.841
Adam, can we discuss the situation?

418
00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:14.841
- Please trust me.
- I have a bad feeling.

419
00:33:15.041 --> 00:33:18.121
Jana, just let me do my job. Okay?

420
00:33:18.921 --> 00:33:19.841
Good night.

421
00:33:45.001 --> 00:33:49.401
What?

422
00:34:02.441 --> 00:34:04.361
F***!

423
00:34:22.241 --> 00:34:23.081
And?

424
00:34:24.121 --> 00:34:24.921
How are things?

425
00:34:26.081 --> 00:34:27.201
I...

426
00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:30.681
I just have to...

427
00:34:33.841 --> 00:34:36.481
Jana, wait a second.

428
00:34:37.281 --> 00:34:38.161
Hey.

429
00:34:42.121 --> 00:34:44.441
Hey. Wait a second.

430
00:34:44.641 --> 00:34:46.481
I just had bad food.

431
00:34:46.681 --> 00:34:50.321
Calm down. Calm down.

432
00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:52.961
Leave it.

433
00:34:53.161 --> 00:34:56.641
Breathe. It's okay.

434
00:35:01.921 --> 00:35:03.641
Sit down.

435
00:35:04.161 --> 00:35:07.801
It's okay. It's alright. Sit down.

436
00:35:08.361 --> 00:35:10.401
Breathe! Breathe!

437
00:35:11.321 --> 00:35:13.241
Deep breaths.

438
00:35:13.441 --> 00:35:14.601
Yes.

439
00:35:18.281 --> 00:35:20.161
Breathe. Breathe.

440
00:35:21.041 --> 00:35:23.561
This panic is just in your head.

441
00:35:24.081 --> 00:35:27.401
Don't fight it.

442
00:35:33.081 --> 00:35:33.681
Breathe.

443
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:46.041
Fearful people are the most dangerous.

444
00:35:47.281 --> 00:35:49.041
So feel free to be afraid.

445
00:35:51.081 --> 00:35:54.241
This pressure and this responsibility,

446
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:56.961
that's difficult.

447
00:35:58.361 --> 00:36:00.041
But you get used to it.

448
00:36:00.641 --> 00:36:03.881
And at some point, the panic goes away.

449
00:36:05.241 --> 00:36:06.121
Trust me.

450
00:36:09.081 --> 00:36:09.881
Calm.

451
00:36:12.401 --> 00:36:13.281
Shall I see you tomorrow?

452
00:36:14.321 --> 00:36:15.601
Yes?

453
00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:24.801
Take care.

454
00:36:48.041 --> 00:36:49.721
- Jana?
<i>- Yes. Hello.</i>

455
00:36:49.921 --> 00:36:51.761
I'm sorry for phoning so late.

456
00:36:53.481 --> 00:36:54.201
You were right.

457
00:36:56.081 --> 00:36:57.081
You have evidence.

458
00:37:00.081 --> 00:37:02.281
I can't sell Leipzig's risk shares.

459
00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:05.281
<i>We only got one bad offer
from Tom Moldovan.</i>

460
00:37:05.681 --> 00:37:07.321
<i>I thought we should make a deal.</i>

461
00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:10.761
You help me get rid of them,

462
00:37:10.961 --> 00:37:12.081
<i>and I'll get you evidence.</i>

463
00:37:14.681 --> 00:37:15.641
How much are we talking about?

464
00:37:16.401 --> 00:37:17.201
400 million.

465
00:37:22.681 --> 00:37:23.761
Someone will be in touch.

466
00:37:25.881 --> 00:37:27.281
- Okay.
<i>- Jana?</i>

467
00:37:28.081 --> 00:37:28.801
Good job.

468
00:37:29.761 --> 00:37:31.561
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>

469
00:37:42.441 --> 00:37:47.481
Connecting

470
00:37:47.681 --> 00:37:48.641
Felix?

471
00:37:51.361 --> 00:37:52.641
I've got something for you.

472
00:37:53.321 --> 00:37:57.521
The entire risk tranches of
the Leipzig project have yet to be sold.

473
00:38:01.121 --> 00:38:04.201
Those are the biggest tranche companies.

474
00:38:04.401 --> 00:38:05.601
Our problem is

475
00:38:05.801 --> 00:38:07.801
that we must sell

476
00:38:08.001 --> 00:38:10.641
our tranches

477
00:38:10.841 --> 00:38:13.921
at too low a price.

478
00:38:16.721 --> 00:38:19.201
I don't like saying it,
but Jana is doing your job.

479
00:38:19.401 --> 00:38:20.401
What?

480
00:38:20.801 --> 00:38:21.921
She's meeting Bender.

481
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:29.801
Hey. What is this?

482
00:38:30.561 --> 00:38:31.641
What are you doing?

483
00:38:32.321 --> 00:38:33.601
Felix Bender is interested.

484
00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:36.601
- What?
- Felix Bender is interested?

485
00:38:36.801 --> 00:38:38.681
Bender is my client. I'll cover him.

486
00:38:38.881 --> 00:38:40.361
And I'm in charge of the tranche.

487
00:38:40.761 --> 00:38:42.001
Adam, you don't.

488
00:38:42.201 --> 00:38:43.601
I saw you working the past half an hour.

489
00:38:43.801 --> 00:38:44.521
You didn't do much.

490
00:38:44.721 --> 00:38:46.561
- You didn't sell any non-rating shares.
- What's wrong?

491
00:38:46.761 --> 00:38:48.481
Do I have to explain
the fundamentals to you?

492
00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:50.201
You're a structurer.

493
00:38:50.401 --> 00:38:52.481
You mustn't engage in sales talks
without me or Fenger.

494
00:38:52.681 --> 00:38:54.761
- I didn't say...
- I'll talk to compliance.

495
00:38:54.961 --> 00:38:57.001
They'll f*** you up!

496
00:38:57.841 --> 00:39:01.561
Adam, I'm advising Bender.
I'm not selling anything.

497
00:39:03.201 --> 00:39:05.561
Jana, don't mess with me.

498
00:39:08.841 --> 00:39:09.761
We'll do it together.

499
00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:11.841
- Okay.
- Okay.

500
00:39:12.041 --> 00:39:14.121
I'm choosing where to go.

501
00:39:14.321 --> 00:39:15.601
I know what he likes.

502
00:39:15.801 --> 00:39:17.721
- Two minutes.
- One minute.

503
00:39:31.801 --> 00:39:35.081
Regatta! Regatta!

504
00:39:35.481 --> 00:39:36.961
Regatta!

505
00:39:37.481 --> 00:39:40.321
Stop this regatta nonsense!
It's just a phenomenon.

506
00:39:40.521 --> 00:39:42.241
Everyone always pretends
to love a regatta.

507
00:39:42.441 --> 00:39:43.601
Yet they all hate it.

508
00:39:43.801 --> 00:39:45.201
I don't.

509
00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:48.001
- Not you. No. How often did you vomit?
- Come on, Felix.

510
00:39:48.201 --> 00:39:49.761
- I made it, didn't I?
- I have to give him credit.

511
00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:51.241
He vomited three times and still lost.

512
00:39:51.601 --> 00:39:53.121
I know it's great to talk
about vomiting,

513
00:39:53.321 --> 00:39:54.601
but we have much to discuss.

514
00:39:54.801 --> 00:39:56.761
And if you hadn't had those drops,

515
00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:59.201
you would have made it too.
And let me tell you something.

516
00:39:59.401 --> 00:40:02.281
Real men vomit and keep drinking.

517
00:40:02.481 --> 00:40:03.321
Okay. Back to Leipzig.

518
00:40:03.521 --> 00:40:04.161
Yes.

519
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:07.961
Felix, let's party now that
you're in the city.

520
00:40:08.161 --> 00:40:09.241
- No, no, no.
- Oh yes.

521
00:40:09.441 --> 00:40:12.441
My sister Birgit

522
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:13.801
from Romania.

523
00:40:15.161 --> 00:40:17.361
Of course, she also brought
too lovely cupcakes along.

524
00:40:17.561 --> 00:40:20.201
- Birgit.
- She's standing tall as always.

525
00:40:23.961 --> 00:40:26.081
- What's with this stupid nonsense?
- I haven't seen Felix in a long time.

526
00:40:26.281 --> 00:40:27.321
Get to the point!

527
00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:28.841
Jana, let me do my job and shut up!

528
00:40:29.041 --> 00:40:31.521
Back to our sweet Felix.

529
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:33.561
Be kind to my dear Felix.

530
00:40:33.761 --> 00:40:36.041
- Yes, that would be...
- A very sweet man.

531
00:40:43.921 --> 00:40:45.481
May we have three more shots?

532
00:40:45.681 --> 00:40:47.441
Do you have chilli?
Or could you add some of this?

533
00:40:47.641 --> 00:40:48.481
Chilli?

534
00:40:48.921 --> 00:40:50.441
Should anyone ask,
there was nothing in it.

535
00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:58.641
Here's mummy! Mummy makes great drinks.

536
00:40:59.921 --> 00:41:01.721
Thanks, mummy.

537
00:41:02.321 --> 00:41:04.481
Bye, Birgit! Cheers!

538
00:41:04.881 --> 00:41:05.761
Cheers.

539
00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:17.561
You okay?

540
00:41:23.721 --> 00:41:25.561
I think I'll get some fresh air.

541
00:41:25.761 --> 00:41:28.041
- Are you okay?
- I'll be right back.

542
00:41:28.241 --> 00:41:29.161
Okay.

543
00:41:31.321 --> 00:41:32.641
He's spent all day in the toilet.

544
00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:35.601
He insisted on coming.
I told him not to have alcohol.

545
00:41:35.801 --> 00:41:38.601
- Pardon?
- Let him defecate now.

546
00:41:38.801 --> 00:41:39.801
We're leaving.

547
00:41:57.361 --> 00:41:59.081
Is it that obvious?

548
00:42:00.401 --> 00:42:02.001
After all of the interactions
with my business partners,

549
00:42:02.201 --> 00:42:03.481
I can't out myself.

550
00:42:04.241 --> 00:42:06.041
That would be mega unauthentic.

551
00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:08.801
I've just missed the right time.

552
00:42:09.001 --> 00:42:10.081
I won't tell anyone.

553
00:42:12.361 --> 00:42:13.761
I've known Leblanc for some time.

554
00:42:13.961 --> 00:42:15.561
It's rare that she respects someone.

555
00:42:18.921 --> 00:42:20.001
Good transition.

556
00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:23.441
How many do you want to buy?

557
00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:26.481
300 million.

558
00:42:32.361 --> 00:42:33.121
Okay.

559
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:35.201
Cool.

560
00:42:36.041 --> 00:42:36.561
Good.

561
00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:38.761
Great decision. Congratulations!

562
00:42:38.961 --> 00:42:39.601
Let's celebrate.

563
00:43:06.521 --> 00:43:08.081
You two look great together!

564
00:43:38.921 --> 00:43:41.681
I'll show you. Like this.

565
00:43:42.801 --> 00:43:44.361
Off with the head.

566
00:43:46.361 --> 00:43:47.521
Nice and smooth.

567
00:43:48.121 --> 00:43:49.961
Don't waste the juice. Now slurp.

568
00:43:54.121 --> 00:43:54.801
So?

569
00:43:55.721 --> 00:43:56.801
Do you like it?

570
00:44:03.401 --> 00:44:06.601
After what I've done,
I won't be able to work at a bank.

571
00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:09.641
I wouldn't want to. It's over.

572
00:44:11.241 --> 00:44:12.201
What do you want to live on?

573
00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:20.321
You're a Mr. Moneybags?

574
00:44:20.521 --> 00:44:22.321
I wouldn't say it like that,

575
00:44:22.521 --> 00:44:25.281
but I can manage for a while.

576
00:44:25.841 --> 00:44:26.841
Crazy.

577
00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:30.121
You know,

578
00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:34.161
I've been unhappy for a very long time.

579
00:44:35.681 --> 00:44:37.001
If you have no money,

580
00:44:37.201 --> 00:44:40.161
it's easy to blame your lack of money

581
00:44:40.361 --> 00:44:43.001
for you being unhappy and not well.

582
00:44:43.201 --> 00:44:47.041
But if you have money
and still don't feel good,

583
00:44:47.761 --> 00:44:50.481
it's either your character

584
00:44:50.681 --> 00:44:53.441
or that you feel like you've done

585
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:54.801
everything wrong so far.

586
00:44:55.361 --> 00:44:57.361
So change your character. Stop crying.

587
00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:59.881
- I'm doing it.
- I can't wait.

588
00:45:00.081 --> 00:45:01.161
You'll see.

589
00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:22.681
Did you see what the kitchen
looks like again?

590
00:45:22.881 --> 00:45:23.401
Oh wow.

591
00:45:23.601 --> 00:45:25.921
Don't 'oh' me!
I don't want to be the one

592
00:45:26.121 --> 00:45:28.281
who always has to clean it all up.

593
00:45:28.481 --> 00:45:29.121
What about the kitchen?

594
00:45:29.321 --> 00:45:31.401
Don't mock me? It's not funny!

595
00:45:31.601 --> 00:45:33.801
You must clean just like me.

596
00:45:34.001 --> 00:45:35.201
I'll do it. Okay.

597
00:45:35.401 --> 00:45:38.201
Please. I want to live in a nice house.

598
00:45:38.401 --> 00:45:39.681
Yes.

599
00:45:40.241 --> 00:45:42.241
Your girlfriend is in your room.

600
00:45:42.441 --> 00:45:43.601
I don't have a girlfriend.

601
00:45:44.001 --> 00:45:46.441
She said she was your girlfriend
and wanted to see you.

602
00:45:46.961 --> 00:45:48.681
I told her to wait.

603
00:45:48.881 --> 00:45:49.521
What does she look like?

604
00:45:53.841 --> 00:45:55.641
- Hello.
- How did you know where I live?

605
00:45:57.081 --> 00:45:57.801
Can we talk?

606
00:45:58.001 --> 00:45:59.401
You can't just come here,

607
00:45:59.601 --> 00:46:01.361
telling her that you're my girlfriend.

608
00:46:02.401 --> 00:46:03.961
That's psycho!

609
00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:05.761
You're sitting at my desk.

610
00:46:07.041 --> 00:46:08.201
Just leave. Okay?

611
00:46:09.121 --> 00:46:11.121
- Can we talk?
- No. No!

612
00:46:12.681 --> 00:46:15.521
- If you knew me...
- I don't want to get to know you.

613
00:46:15.721 --> 00:46:16.681
You'd like me.

614
00:46:17.721 --> 00:46:19.321
Just leave. Okay?

615
00:46:29.241 --> 00:46:30.481
Thao, stop.

616
00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:32.561
Thao, don't.

617
00:46:33.841 --> 00:46:35.041
Remove your hand.

618
00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:39.881
Ow! Stop! Stop! Let go!

619
00:46:40.081 --> 00:46:41.081
Everything okay?

620
00:46:41.281 --> 00:46:42.561
F*** off!

621
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:45.521
You can't do that!

622
00:46:46.921 --> 00:46:48.001
Let go!

623
00:47:00.201 --> 00:47:03.841
I'm calling the police! You're psycho!

624
00:47:04.041 --> 00:47:06.201
Tom, it's Adam again.

625
00:47:06.401 --> 00:47:07.841
You're not answering your phone.

626
00:47:08.721 --> 00:47:10.721
I wasn't able to further reduce
the price.

627
00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:12.641
We must find another way.

628
00:47:12.841 --> 00:47:14.121
Please call me back.

629
00:47:14.321 --> 00:47:16.001
Don't do anything with those photos.

630
00:47:16.201 --> 00:47:17.361
I mean...

631
00:47:18.281 --> 00:47:20.001
It was a great joke.

632
00:47:20.601 --> 00:47:22.201
But you wouldn't actually send them.

633
00:47:22.401 --> 00:47:24.081
You wouldn't, would you? We're friends.

634
00:47:24.281 --> 00:47:24.881
Call me, Tom.

635
00:47:27.201 --> 00:47:28.201
F***!

636
00:47:56.001 --> 00:47:57.721
I've always liked...

637
00:47:57.921 --> 00:48:00.641
Get some rest and thank you!

638
00:48:26.881 --> 00:48:30.001
Need help

639
00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:20.761
Did you just pretend to be normal?

640
00:49:21.361 --> 00:49:24.481
Sabine, it's not that bad.

641
00:49:26.401 --> 00:49:28.601
Don't touch me, you sick a***hole!

642
00:49:48.561 --> 00:49:51.441
- Get some sleep, Flo.
- No.

643
00:49:51.641 --> 00:49:54.321
- Your mother is going to kill me.
- Is mummy coming back tomorrow?

644
00:49:56.361 --> 00:49:56.881
No.

645
00:49:59.041 --> 00:50:00.761
- Why?
- Good night.

646
00:50:13.121 --> 00:50:15.961
It's alright. Hey.

647
00:50:20.681 --> 00:50:23.761
It'll be okay.
